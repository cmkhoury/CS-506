## CS-506 - CartCombo

Instructions for use:
 - Run `$ python environmentSetup.py` from the top level directory.  This will install the necessary dependancies, including <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/" target="_blank">Flask<a>, which our server runs on, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt" target="_blank">bycrpt</a>, which we use to encrypt user passwords. 
 - Then, run `$ python cartCombo_app.py` from the top level directory.  This will start a small host to enable interaction with CartCombo webpages, creating a new account (then logging in), viewing other users' profiles, etc.
